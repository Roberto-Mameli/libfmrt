This directory contains several dataset files, which have been obtained
by adapting a file (items.csv) downloaded from the following website:

   https://archive.org/details/UpcDatabase2010-06-01

Some work has been done to reformat the file and to clean it from
spurious data. The result is file:

   items.csv.out

which contains almost 1,260,000 rows. There are smaller files extracted
by the one above:

   items_xxx.csv

where xxx represents the amount of data (e.g. 10K stands for 10,000 rows
and so on). Be aware that files are ordered with respect to the key, which
implies that the time needed to load it increases more than linearly with
respect to the number of elements (see library documentation for details).
As an example, 1,000 elements are read almost istantaneously, 10,000 elements
are read with a rate of about 1000 items/s, 100,000 elements are read with a
rate of about 150 item/s, and so on (being ordered, every insertion requires
full rebalancing of the tree, so that the insertion rate decreases as soon
as the table becomes more populated).
